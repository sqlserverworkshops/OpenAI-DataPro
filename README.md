Businesses require the ability to use Artificial Intelligence within all parts of their solutions. However, one size does not fit all solutions. The key for correctly applying AI into solutions is to first understand the requirements and constraints for the solution, and then to fully understand the background, mechanisms, and tools you can use to solve for the solution. This course provides an explanation of how AI developed over time, and the multiple tools and platforms you can use to implement it. It focuses on the data solutions in and on the Microsoft Azure Data platform, and includes on-premises solutions such as Microsoft SQL Server.

The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.
